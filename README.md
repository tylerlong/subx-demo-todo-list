# React & SubX TodoMVC Example

[SubX](https://github.com/tylerlong/subx) is the next generation state container which could replace Redux and MobX. It is flexible yet easy to use.

Use [react-subx](https://github.com/tylerlong/react-subx) if you want to use React together with SubX.

## Note

- Pitfall: You should not save props in constructor and use it in render. Because they will not be tracked at all.
- > This page is using the development build of React.
